  ##### Work Summary
  
  1. Find out datacards(English Part) start with "pseudocrawl", *eg.pseudocrawl-filtered_667_www_bhaskar_com*,[detailed work](https://github.com/ChenYb9807/ENGI8000/blob/main/Pseudocrawl%20data%20in%20BigScience.py)
    
  2. Try to use python library [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scrape news text from 16 countries. Not a good idea. [Demo](https://github.com/ChenYb9807/ENGI8000/blob/main/Scraping%20with%20Newspaper3k.py). The library is not that powerful.
  
  3. Collect great source for newspaper archive, [India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/archive.cms),[Afghanistan](https://www.eastview.com/resources/gpa/afghan-central-press/),[Australia,Canada&UK](https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/newsroom/explore/index.html),[Iran](https://www.tehrantimes.com/archive),[Nigeria](https://archive-it.org/collections/11796),[Sri Lanka](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/210110/archive/),[Finland](https://www.dailyfinland.fi/archive).This can be helpful for better web scraping result.
  
  4. BigScience dataset contains many news irrelavant corpus, wiki, and many text in forum website. The most valuable part for our study might be those newspaper in Singapore. *Dataset uid: pseudocrawl-filtered_497_www_straitstimes_com* It's big enough and relevant to our study.
  
   ##### Future work
   
   Successfully crawl data from India by Saturday and communicate with other members doing scraping work, make sure we have access to at least 6 countries newspapers by Tuesday.

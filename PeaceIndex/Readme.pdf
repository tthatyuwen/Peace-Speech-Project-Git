To define High-Peace and Low-Peace Countries, we have referred to 5 indexes: 
  Global Peace Index (GPI), Positive Peace Index (PPI), Human Development Index (HDI),World Happiness Index (WHI),Fragile States Index (FSI) for 137 countries, 
and try to define our own peace indexes.

Briefly calculating the correlation matrix bewteen five indexes:

     WHI   HDI   FSI   PPI   GPI
WHI   1    0.79  0.81  0.78  0.57
HDI  0.79   1    0.86  0.85  0.58
FSI  0.81  0.86   1    0.96  0.80
PPI  0.78  0.85  0.96    1   0.74
GPI  0.57  0.58  0.8   0.74   1

It is easy to find these indexes are highly correlated.

There are two basic unsupervised learning methods: Principle Component Analysis and K-means. 
Since different indexes may have different variation and PCA can help us directly reach a single index intuitivelyï¼Œwe choose to apply PCA.

It turns out that the singular values of PCA are [557 172 120 100 48], 
the explained variance ratio are [0.846 0.081 0.04 0.03 0.01]

It is valid to use the first component of PCA to represent peace index, which is:
peace_index = -(0.36*WHI+0.51*HDI+0.51*FSI+0.50*PPI+0.32*GPI)

To make this more readable, we have done some rescaled work(multiple (-1), using min-max to make the index range from 0 to 100)
The result is presented in peace_index_pca.xlsx.

We divide the countries into 3 groups: High Peace, Medium Peace, Low Peace and choose 16 countries(8 from High Peace, 8 from Low peace):
  High Peace        Low Peace
  Finland           Iran
  Norway            Gambia
  Ireland           India
  Canada            Libya
  Australia         Uganda
  Singapore         Pakistan
  UK                Nigeria
  France            Zimbabwe
